Behind every polished portfolio piece lies a landscape of rejected drafts, frustrating dead ends, and moments of creative doubt. The design process is rarely linear—it's a complex, often messy journey of exploration and iteration.

My workflow begins with rapid, imperfect sketching. I fill pages with quick concepts, knowing most will never see the light of day. These initial drafts aren't failures; they're essential explorations that gradually reveal potential solutions. Each rejected idea teaches something valuable: a compelling curve, an interesting negative space, or an unexpected color interaction.

Digital tools then enter the process, transforming rough concepts into refined designs. But even here, the journey continues. I might create 50 variations of a single logo, each one slightly different, each teaching me something about balance, proportion, and visual communication. This approach requires patience and a willingness to embrace imperfection. Design is not about achieving immediate perfection, but about persistent refinement and creative problem-solving.
